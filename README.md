### Introduction

The objective of this project is to produce a group of tools that can support modelling various financial scenarios. 

These financial scenarios are based off options for investing in property and/or shares. The tools should be able to help compare the different scenarios over a long time.

### User Stories

* show the required weekly/monthly rent required to cover loan costs
* include upkeep costs such as insurance, management, strata and rates
* calculate the required payments for each loan
* be able to effectively compare two loans
* be able to model scenarios containing multiple loans

When modeling multiple loans, I want to know these things

Stretch
* Model implications of having offset account
* Total interest cost over the life of the loan
* Cost relative to sqr meterage
